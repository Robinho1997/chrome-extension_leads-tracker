In this super cool project I created a leads tracker chrome extension!

With this chrome extension you are able to save your current tab or/and save whatever url you wish to save. 
Just type the url in the input field, click on the save input button and your favourite url is saved right there on the spot really quick and neat!

In this project I used and deepen my skills about:

- DOM Manipulation
- localStorage
- template strings
- function parameters
- JSON
- objects in arrays
